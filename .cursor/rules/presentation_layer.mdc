# Presentation Layer

The presentation layer is responsible for everything related to the user interface.

## Subdirectories

- **`view`**: Contains the UI components (e.g., screens, widgets, pages).
- **`viewmodel`** or **`bloc`** or **`controller`**: Contains the presentation logic that interacts with the domain layer's use cases. This part of the presentation layer drives the UI.

## Example Structure for `auth/presentation`
```
auth/
└── presentation/
├── view/
│   ├── login_screen.dart
│   └── register_screen.dart
└── viewmodel/
└── auth_viewmodel.dart
```

## ViewModels / BLoCs / Controllers

- They should call use cases from the domain layer to perform business operations.
- They expose state and events to the UI.
- They should not contain any business logic directly.
- They format data from the domain layer in a way that is easily consumable by the UI.
